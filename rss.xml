            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Stunning Mansion in Ex Machina</h1><p>There are many stunning, otherworldly sights in Ex Machina, the science-fiction film directed by Alex Garland that features a robot so lifelike she's played by actress Alicia Vikander. But the most breathtaking sight of all may be the 100 percent real, available-for-a-night's-stay location where the film is set: the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/681669ff82d513a623869d49c9b8fe8ee3c88229.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla. Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Untold Story of Magic Leap, the World's Most Secretive Startup</h1><p>T There is something special happening in a generic office park in an uninspiring suburb near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Inside, amid the low gray cubicles, clustered desks, and empty swivel chairs, an impossible 8-inch robot drone from an alien planet hovers chest-high in front of a row of potted plants.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c074a0d302be59dce473c720dd3426bf33ec9c32.jpg"></article>]]></description>
